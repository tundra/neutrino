## Returns true if the two strings contain the exact same characters. Note that
## there are many meaningful ways to compare strings for equality. This one does
## the dumbest thing possible and looks at the raw underlying characters of the
## string, ignoring character equivalences. This means that if you use this on
## non-ascii input that has not been explicitly normalized this may not give you
## the result you expect, and indeed for user-supplied input you will almost
## always want to use something else.
## TODO: implement the above mentioned "something else".

## Returns an ascii character array containing the characters of this string.
## TODO: This so is not how this should work but it's one of those things that
##   will have to do for now.
