/// # Process and execution objects
///
/// Types related to process execution are defined in this header. The code that
/// actually executes bytecode lives in {{interp.h}}.
///
/// The aim has been to have a few different execution mechanisms that work as
/// a foundation for the control abstractions provided by the surface language.
/// The main abstractions are:
///
///   - Segmented {{#Stack}}(Stacks). A stack segment is known as a
///     {{#StackPiece}}(stack piece). A stack segment is basically a dumb object
///     array, both of these types have very little functionality on their own.
///   - The {{#Frame}}(frame) type provides access to a segmented stack, both
///     for inspection and modification. This is a stack-allocated type, not
///     heap allocated.
///   - {{#Escape}}(Escapes) capture the information you need to do a non-local
///     return. They can be thought of as pointers into the stack which allow
///     you top abort execution and jump back to the place they're pointing to.
///     If you know `setjmp`/`longjmp` from
///     [setjmp.h](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h), this is basically the
///     same thing.
///   - Various closures: {{#Lambda}}(lambdas), {{#Block}}(blocks), and
///     {{#CodeShard}}(code shards). These are similar but work slightly differently:
///     lambdas and blocks are visible at the surface language level; they're
///     different in that lambdas can outlive their scope so they have to
///     capture the values they close over whereas blocks are killed when their
///     scope exits and so can access outer values directly through the stack.
///     Code shards are like blocks but are not visible on the surface so they
///     don't need to be killed because the runtime knows they won't outlive
///     their scope.

/// ## Stack piece
///
/// A stack piece is a contiguous segment of a segmented call stack. The actual
/// backing store of a stack piece is just an array. All values on the stack are
/// properly tagged so a stack piece can be gc'ed trivially.
///
/// ### Open vs. closed
///
/// A stack piece can be either _open_ or _closed_. All interaction with a stack
/// piece happens through a `frame_t` which holds information about the piece's
/// top frame. Opening a stack piece means writing information about the top
/// frame into a `frame_t`. Closing it means writing the information back into
/// the piece. Saving information about the current top frame also happens when
/// invoking a method and the same code is responsible for doing both. The fake
/// frame that is at the top of a closed stack piece is called the _lid_.
///
/// ### Stack pointer
///
/// Stack pieces have a pointer back to the stack they're a part of (unless
/// they're not a member of one in which case the pointer is nothing). Stack
/// validation checks that all pieces point to the stack so make sure to always
/// set the stack pointer on a piece first before putting the piece into the
/// stack.

///
/// Most of the execution works with individual stack pieces, not the stack, but
/// but whenever we need to manipulate the pieces, create new ones for instance,
/// that's the stack's responsibility.
///
/// The stack is also responsible for the _barriers_ that are threaded all the
/// way through the stack pieces. A barrier is a section of a stack piece that
/// must be processed before the scope that created the barrier exits. During
/// normal execution the scope's code ensures that the barrier is processed
/// whereas when escaping the barriers are traversed and processed from the
/// outside. This is how ensure blocks are implemented: a barrier is pushed that
/// when processed executes the code corresponding to the ensure block.
///
/// Each barrier contains a pointer to the next one so the stack only needs to
/// keep track of the top one and it'll point to the others. That's convenient
/// because it means that all the space required to hold the barriers can be
/// stack allocated.

// one. It is passed as a value rather than a size because the value is easily

/// ## Escape
///
/// An escape is a scoped object that encapsulates the execution state at a
/// a point immediately after the place where the escape was created
/// (_captured_). When fired, the escape restores the state effectively
/// returning, possibly non-locally, to immediately after the capture point.
/// This is how constructs like return, break, continue, etc., is implemented.
///
/// ### Escape home
///
/// Since an escape is scoped, that is, it is invalidated as soon as the scope
/// that created it exits, most of its state can be stored on the stack as a
/// derived escape section object. The escape itself is just a pointer to its
/// state on the stack.
///
/// An escape uses two stack regions: the state to return to when fired and a
/// barrier which ensures that the escape object is invalidated however the
/// scope exits.
///
/// ### Escaping through barriers
///
/// When an escape is fired we can't jump directly back to where it was created,
/// we first have to execute all barriers between the current point of execution
/// and the escape's origin. This is done by "parking" the interpreter at a
/// bytecode and never advancing the program counter. At each turn around the
/// interpreter the same instruction is executed which fetches the next barrier
/// comparing it with the escape's destination, and if the barrier is above it
/// the associated handler is executed.
///
/// ### Returning multiple times through the same escape
///
/// To a first approximation escapes can only be fired once because firing an
/// escape causes execution to exit the scope that created it -- that's the
/// whole point -- which causes the escape to be invalidated. However, that is
/// actually not the whole story. Since escapes don't jump directly out but
/// process barriers first it is possible for a barrier to interrupt the escape
/// by firing a _different_ escape that doesn't escape as far out as the
/// original did. So a more accurate way to think of the escape process (though
/// not necessarily more useful in practice) is not as a direct jump to the
/// origin but as an _attempt_ to escape there, an attempt that can be stopped
/// by barriers along the way. The same escape can be attempted as many times
/// as you want -- as long as it doesn't succeed, once it's succeeded it is
/// immediately invalidated.
///
/// Is this the behavior you want? I think it probably is. In any case, it falls
/// out if you take a straightforward formulation of escapes and barriers so
/// to get a different behavior you'd have to either change how escapes or
/// barriers work more generally, or have a special case here which would make
/// them less orthogonal.
