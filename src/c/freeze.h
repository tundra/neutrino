/// # Value freezing
///
/// Any value can be in one of four modes. These modes indicate which operations
/// are legal. A value starts out least restricted and can then move towards
/// more restrictions, never fewer. The modes are:
///
///   - _Fluid_: Any changes can be made to this object, including changing
///      which type it belongs to and which global fields it has.
///   - _Mutable_: The object's fields can be set but no changes can be made to
///      which global fields exist or which primary type it has.
///   - _Frozen_: The object cannot be changed but can reference other objects
///     that can.
///   - _Deep frozen_: The object cannot change and neither can any objects it
///     references.
///
/// Not all values can be in all states. For instance, integers and strings
/// start out deep frozen so the less restricted states don't apply to them.
///
/// You can explicitly move an object to the mutable or frozen mode if you know
/// the object is in a less restricted mode but you can't make it deep frozen,
/// and you don't need to. Being deep frozen is a property of a full object
/// graph so you can ask if an object is deep frozen and the object graph will
/// be traversed for you to determine whether it is. That traversal may cause
/// the object to be marked as deep frozen.
///
/// ### Ownership
///
/// Some values are considered to logically *own* other values. For instance,
/// an id hash map owns its entry array, an array buffer owns it storage array,
/// and the roots object owns all the roots. Basically, if creating one object
/// requires another object to be created that isn't passed to it from elsewhere
/// then the object is owned. The place you see this is mainly around freezing.
/// If you freeze an object (not shallow-freeze, freeze) then the object is
/// responsible for freezing any objects it owns. You can think of it as a
/// matter of encapsulation. If an object needs some other objects to function
/// which it otherwise doesn't expose to you then that's that object's business
/// and it should be transparent when freezing it that those other objects
/// exist. If freezing it didn't recursively freeze those you could tell they
/// existed because they would prevent it from being deep frozen.
///
/// Ownership is strictly linear: if object _a_ owns object _b_ then _b_ may
/// itself own other objects, but it must not be the case that _b_ or something
/// transitively owned by _b_ considers itself to own _a_.
///
/// ### Cheating
///
/// The deep freezing infrastructure is based on the same object-layout
/// inspection code that the gc uses which means that except for ownership
/// families don't need explicit support for deciding whether an object is deep
/// frozen. This also means that you can't easily decide to cheat for a
/// particular field and claim that it is deep frozen when it isn't, because
/// the deep freezing code doesn't know what the fields mean, it just knows that
/// whatever they are they must be frozen. To deal with this there's a separate
/// `ofFreezeCheat` family which claims to be deep frozen but in reality can be
/// mutated. Use with caution.

// has any references including owned references (for instance the entry array
// in an id hash map) they will not be frozen by this.

// deep frozen as we go. If this succeeds returns the internal true value,
// otherwise the internal false value. Marking the objects as deep frozen may
// under some circumstances involve allocation; if there is a problem there a
// condition may be returned.
//
// If validation fails and the offender_out parameter is non-null, an arbitrary
// mutable object from the object graph will be stored there. This is a
// debugging aid, since it's arbitrary which object will be stored you should
// not depend on the particular value in any way.
//
// This is the only reliable way to check whether a value is deep frozen since
// being deep frozen is a property of an object graph, not an individual object,
// and using marking like this is the only efficient way to reliably determine
// that property.

/// you to set its value at any time. If there is _any_ way for you to avoid
/// using this, do.
